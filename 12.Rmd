# Multivariate MLM (MMLM)

- MMLM is used when you have multiple outcome measures that you do not want to combine into a single score. No correction for multiple tests is needed, therefore increasing power. 
- Example of data for MMLM: 
  * Example: Breathing  training to treat asthma and anxiety/depressive symptoms in people with Asthma.
  * RCT: Treatment group received breathing training treatment with biofeedback to lower pCO2 (CART). Placebo group received sham breathing training to simply slow respiration (PBO). 
  * Psychological DVs: HADS-A, ASI, HADS-D, and PANAS-N
  * Assessment: baseline, posttreatment, 3MFU, 6MFU

## Preparing Your Data for MMLM 

- Create a unique ID for each assessment at which the multiple DVs are assessed. This is often formed by computing a new ID variable called something like IDindex1=ID$*$10+index1 (note, if there are more than 9 levels of the index, you will need to do IDindex1=ID*100+index1).
- Z score each individual DV so that the DVs are all on the same scale.
- Restructure the dataset so that each DV is on a separate line within each asmt. I recommend calling the new composite outcome column (variable) with the name of your multiple DVs in the order in which they appear in the file.
- When you get to the index name in the restructuring procedure, call it something different from index1 since you probably have index1 in your data file (I called it indexDV).
- The new stacked data file will be x times longer than the original data file, where x is the number of DVs (2 in this case).

## More Interpretation of MMLM 

- One additional cool thing you can do with MMLM is determine whether the DVs are all affected in the same way by the IVs. To do this, you create dummy variables for the DVs. You select one of your DVs as the “reference DV”, and create a dummy code for the other DVs.
- DUMPANASN is coded from indexDV so that PANASN=1, and all others are =0.
- You then use the Dummy variables as a moderator of all the IVs in your original model.
- If any of the interactions between DUMDVs and an IV are significant, you know that the effect of that variable on one variable is significantly different than for the reference DV. If HADS-A was the reference, the main effects of that IV are the effect for HADS-A.

## How to Execute MMLM in SPSS 

- Under the subjects box, first list IDindex1, and then below that, put ID. Then, in repeated put IndexDV, and select an unstructured covariance matrix. This nests repeated DVs within each IDindex1, which is nested within students.
- Your composite DV variable is the DV. Then put whatever predictors you want into the factors or covariates. If it is a growth curve model, just put you normal growth curve parameters in the model as you normally would (e.g., timec4 and CART0).
- Fill in fixed as you normally would, as well as ML and stats. But the RANDOM box is different.
- In RANDOM, first move over IDindex1. Then, to be able to add another level, you will have to check the intercept box. Then move over ID. You will usually want an intercept, but you don’t HAVE to include an intercept. You can also include other student level random effects if you want, like timec5. Then go back to the previous level (IDindex1 level) by hitting the “previous” button in the upper left corner of the random pop-up menu. Take out the intercept for that level (if you use unstructured at level 1, you can’t have any REs at level 1).

## Interpretation of MMLM

- After you run the model, you interpret effects just like you would for any model. The only difference is that the effects are for the group of DVs, not for individual DVs.
- You can use the same MMLM approach for models other than growth curve models, like TVPs and baseline covariate models.
- You can also use any kind of growth curve model, including ANOVA.
- But, MMLM assumes that all variables are affected in the same way by the predictors. Don’t include variables that are coded in the opposite directions (e.g., school performance, and classroom misbehaviors).

## Homework 15 - 11/14

In the attached data set, people with panic disorder get 10 weekly treatments (session = 1-10) and a final post treatment assessment 1 week after the last treatment (session=11). There is only one group. There are multiple DVs: ASI, ACQ, FFMQ, and PDSStot. Do an MMLM. DO a simple linear model for Time. Do patients improve over time on the group of the 4 DVs in your MMLM?

Yes, patients do appear to improve significantly over time on the 4 DVs.

Intercept + timec12 Interpretations:

UN(1,1): There is not a significant difference in their level of outcomes/symptoms between subjects at posttreatment. There is not significant variability in their overall symptoms across the four variables at posttreatment.

UN(2,1): There is no relationship between their level at the end (intercept/symptoms at posttreatement) and their rate of improvement.

UN(2,2): There is not significant variability between subjects in their change of the 4 DVs over time.


## Homework 16 - 11/21

In the attached data, the 4 DVS are HADSA, HADSD, ASI, and PANASneg. They are measured at 4 time points, index1=1,7,8,9. Convert index1 to time=1,2,3,4. CART0 is the treatment group variable: CART0=0 is CART breathing training, and CART0=1 is the slow breathing control condition. Do an MMLM. Use a linear growth curve model as your growth model (treatment, time, and treatment x time). Center time at the last outcome. We expect the effect of treatment (the CART0 main effect at time 4) to be greater for the anxiety outcomes (HADSA and ASI) than for the mood outcomes (HADSD, PANASneg). See if you can figure out how you can code a single dummy variable for the repeated outcome measures (indexed by their DV number 1-4) to code anxiety or depressive symptoms. Then have that dummy code interact with CART0, Timec4, and CART0 x Timec4. Interpret the interactions. You can email me for hints.

`timec4` main effect: The slope of decrease in mood symptoms (HADSD, PANASneg; AnxietyIndex=0) for participants in the breathing training (CART0=0) condition was significant.

`CART0` main effect: The difference between the two conditions (CART0=0 vs. CART0=1; treatment vs. control) in terms of the mood symptoms was not significant at the last timepoint.

`AnxietyIndex` main effect: The difference in levels of mood and anxiety symptoms (AnxietyIndex=0 vs. AnxietyIndex=1; mood vs. anxiety) for participants in the treatment condition (CART0=0; breathing training) at the last timepoint was not significant. 

`timec4*CART0` interaction effect: The slope of decrease in mood symptoms over time was not significantly moderated by condition (CART0=0 vs. CART0=1).

`CART0*AnxietyIndex` interaction effect: The difference in the effect of condition (CART0=0 vs. CART0=1) on mood vs. anxiety symptoms was not significant at the last timepoint (timec4=0).

`timec4*AnxietyIndex` interaction effect: The difference in the effect of time on mood vs. anxiety symptoms was not significant for individuals in the treatment (CART0=0) condition.

`timec4*CART0*AnxietyIndex` interaction effect: The slope of decrease in symptoms over time was not significantly moderated by condition regardless of whether they were anxiety or mood symptoms.
