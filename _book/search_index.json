For example, cortisol increases early in the morning, then decreases, and then levels off. This is hard to model functionally. In such cases, if you don’t have too many assessments, you may consider an ANOVA. ANOVA will always give you the best model fit (-2LL) because it estimates each mean at each assessment exactly, but it may not give you the lowest AIC and BIC. In other words, ANOVA model estimates each mean separately and independently. We need to dummy-code variables for each time point, effectively treating time as a categorical variable as opposed to a continuous variable. In this analysis, all “Factor” variables will be dummy coded, with the “highest” category being used as the “reference” category. So a dummy variable will be created for all the other levels of the variable (except the highest level) and every comparison will be to the reference group (the highest level). 7.2 Conducting MLM ANOVA ANOVA is performed within SPSS mixed effects by putting your variables in the “Factors” box instead of in the “covariates” box. SPSS does an ANOVA treating the variables in the “Factors” box as categorical. (Behind the scenes, it codes TIME as a categorical variable, with k-1 dummy variables for TIME (see below). Thus, don’t put a continuous variable in the “Factors” box in the SPSS routine). You can mix and match variables in the fixed box with variables in the covariates box. 7.3 Interpreting MLM ANOVA Results The results for an MLM ANOVA are very much like that from a regular ANOVA. The main effects are NOT like in regression. In these analyses, the main effects for an interaction are the AVERAGE effects of each variable COLLAPSING OVER THE OTHER VARIABLE. Thus, If you have a treatment x time interaction, the main effect for treatment is the average effect over all the time points (not the effect of treatment at time=0). Similarly, the effect of time is the average effect of time over all conditions, not the effect of time for treatment=0. Note that in ANOVA, you get MEANS not SLOPEs. You request the means by selecting “EM Means” and selecting the means you want displayed. You can also do multiple comparisons for the main effects by selecting comparisons. You should usually select SIDAK, because LSD is too liberal (no correction for the multiple comparisons) and Bonferroni is too conservative (too much correction for the multiple comparisons). Thus, the main effects are not dependent upon how you center the variables. For example, the main effect of time is the same no matter how treatment is coded. If you ask for the parameter estimates under the statistics button you will get a regression analysis for the model. All the coefficients in these parameter estimates can be interpreted as they would be in a normal regression with categorical variables that are dummy coded. Note that this does not change the ANOVA table, or the interpretation of the main effects and interactions in the ANOVA table of effects. Other variables can go into the “Factors” box besides time. For example, you can include potential moderators (like site). Or just use it as a covariate. Just remember, don’t put a continuous variable in the “Factors” box. You can include continuous variables as covariates, and they can interact with your “factor” variables, but don’t put continuous variables in the “Factors” box since it creates a dummy variable for every level of each variable in the “Factors” box. You can be completely flexible on your analytical design (main effects and interactions). - If you enter the covariate as a main effect only, you are assuming that the relation between the covariate and outcome is the same across all levels of the other variables. When you model interactions between covariates and “factor” variables, SPSS automatically creates dummy variables for the factor variable, and forms interactions between each dummy (for the factor variable) and the covariate. 7.4 Homework 8 - 10/3 We have assessments at pre, post, and FU for pds (panic disorder symptoms). We have 2 groups (imi=0 is CBT, imi=1 is a drug). Using an unstructured covariance matrix, determine which growth curve model, linear, log or ANOVA, has the best fit. Please include imi, time, and imi x time interaction. Next, as a challenge, dummy variable code your variables so that you can compare pre to post in the CBT condition. Is the -2LL for this model the same as in the ANOVA? * LINEAR. COMPUTE Index1c3=Index1 - 3. EXECUTE.
