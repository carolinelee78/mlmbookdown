When we think of repeated measures, we usually think of change over time as our primary outcome. However, MLM for longitudinal data is used not only to investigate change over Time (i.e., the growth curve of outcome over time) but also to examine the covariation of a variable with an outcome over time (as in a diary study in which you are interested in how 2 variables relate to each other within-individuals over time). These relations over time can be expanded to investigate causal inference as we will see later. In the case of growth curve models (change over time), time is a predictor of outcome and it can be modeled as curvilinear as well as linear. Modeling the “correct” growth curve will be important. In the “covariation” models, Time may or may not be included in the model depending on whether you think that there may some systematic change in outcome over time. In these models, your predictor is the repeated measurements of your IV (e.g., mood) predicting repeated measurements of your DV (e.g., grades in school). 2.1 Levels of analyses in MLM In MLM, your data is organized at multiple levels, and we need to distinguish between-person relationships from within-person relationships. The phrase between-person simply refers to the existence of interindividual variation (i.e., differences between people). The term between-person relationships is used to capture how individual differences on one outcome are related to individual differences on another outcome. People can also differ from each other in stable attributes, such as ethnicity or biological sex. People can also differ from each other in attributes like intelligence, personality, or SES that could potentially change over time. But if those attributes are assessed at only a single point in time, then those values obtained at that particular occasion are assumed to be stable and reflective of the person as a whole - in other words, the attributes are considered time-invariant. Thus, the phrase between-person refers to relationships among interindividual differences in variables that are time-invariant. Furthermore, in the longitudinal models to be presented, the between-person level of analysis is usually labeled as level 2, or the macro level of analysis. 2.1.1 Level 1 The level-1 equation is the equation for the “within-subject” change over time (or the within-subject relation between 2 variables over time). This can be the relation between time and outcome (as in the graph below) or the relation between a predictor and outcome over time. In the case of linear time predicting outcome, the regression equation for each person is: \\[ Y_j = b_0 + b_1 * T_j + \\epsilon_j \\] where \\(Y_j\\) is the outcome of assessment \\(j\\), \\(T_j\\) is TIme at assessment \\(j\\) (often coded as 0-\\(k\\), where \\(k\\) is the number of weeks since baseline), \\(epsilon_j\\) is the error in predicting the outcome at assessment \\(j\\), \\(b_0\\) is the intercept, and \\(b_11\\) is the slope of outcome over time. In MLM, the parameters in this model (e.g., the intercept and slope) are calculated for each individual in the study and can be different for each individual. If \\(i\\) represents the different individuals in your study, equation 1 can be written for all the individuals as: \\[ Y_{ij} = b_{0i} + b_{1i}*T_{ij} + \\epsilon_{ij} \\] So, each individual has a different intercept and a different slope. Each person has their own growth curve that best fits their own data. The value of the intercept depends on how time is coded since the intercept is the expected value of the outcome when all other variables in the equation are 0. Thus, if time is coded 0, 1, 2, 3, the intercept is the expected value of \\(Y\\) at “baseline” (the first assessment). If time is coded 1,2,3,4, the intercept is still the expected value when time=0, but in this case, it would be meaningless. The error in the level-1 model is the error in predicting each data point for each person. Each person has an error at each time point, so these errors can be considered variables \\(e_1 ... e_k\\), if there are \\(k\\) assessments. The variance of the error at each time point is referred to as \\(\\sigma_{j}^2\\). The error variance is assumed to be equal at each time point in most simple MLM analyses, but the error covariance matrix can be specified in a more complex manner. The \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) are assumed to be normally distributed. 2.1.2 Level 2 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
