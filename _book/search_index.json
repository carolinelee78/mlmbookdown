This formula is an approximation that is valid for practical use when the test in question is a one-sided t-test with a reasonably large number of degrees of freedom (say, df â‰¥ 10). We suppose that the effect size is expressed by a parameter that we can estimate with a certain standard error. Bear in mind that the size of the standard error is a monotone decreasing function of the sample size: the larger the sample size the smaller the standard error! Formula would be (effect size / standard error) \\(\\approx (z_{1-\\alpha} + z_{1-\\beta}) = (z_{1-\\alpha}-z_\\beta)\\) where \\(z_\\alpha\\), \\(z_\\beta\\), and \\(z_{1-\\beta}\\) are the z-scores (values from the standard normal distribution) associated with the indicated \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) values. If, for instance, \\(\\alpha\\) is chosen at .05 and 1-\\(\\beta\\) at .80 (thus being .20), and a medium effect size of .50 is what we expect, then we can derive that we are searching for a minimum sample size that satisfies standard error \\(\\leq [.50 / (1.64 + 0.84)] {\\Leftrightarrow}\\) standard error \\(\\leq\\) .20. For the purposes of calculating standard errors, three categories of predictor variables must be distinguished: micro level variables with only a fixed effect; micro level variables with a fixed and a random effect; macro level variables explaining between-group variability. Within subjects deviation = micro, between subjects = macro e.g., time can be 1 or 2 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
