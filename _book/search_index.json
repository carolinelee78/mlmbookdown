In that case, you can try a “logarithmic” model. This is for data that drop more quickly and approach an asymptote, or increase quickly and then approach an asymptote. For a log model, you transform the Time variable by taking the ln(Time). But remember, you can’t take the log of a negative number, and the log of 0 is negative infinity. So, we usually take the ln of “1+Time”, if time is coded 0+ (e.g., if time is coded 0,1,2,3,4, or 0,4,16,26,52, you need to add 1). Following this procedure means that the ln of Time will equal 0 for time=0 (baseline), since ln(1+0)=ln(1)=0. Thus, the main effect for condition will be the condition differences at baseline. To determine whether there are condition differences at post (week 16), do the following: Post (wk 16) is equivalent to lntime=ln(1+16)=ln(17)=2.83. So, once you have created the variable lntime=ln(1+timewks), you center lntime at 2.83. Then the main effect for condition will be its effect at wk 16. 5.2 Logarithmic Growth Curve Models How does one assess if the logarithmic model is better than the quadratic model? Since it is not nested within the quadratic model, you cannot use the difference in -2LL. The alternative is to use the AIC and BIC. Select the model with the lowest AIC and BIC. Although you cannot perform a significance test on the difference in AIC or BIC, differences on the BIC &gt; 10 are considered “large”. See Singer &amp; Willett pp. 116-122. Remember, since the comparison of these models involve differences in the Fixed Effects, you should use ML estimation (not RML) to calculate the model. 5.3 Hyperbolic Growth Curve Models Another alternative coding for time is hyperbolic. In this case, the new time variable is Timehyper = 1 – (1/(time)) if time is 1 or greater or Timehyper = 1 – (1/(time+1)) if time is 0 or greater. This coding is appropriate for outcomes that drop off more rapidly and then level off more quickly (or which increase rapidly and then level off at an asymptote quickly) than log models. Note: None of these transformations of time allow outcome to decrease and then increase. For that, you have to use powers of time (quadratic, cubic, quartic, etc). 5.4 Piecewise Growth Curve Models Sometimes, your GCM has completely different “phases” so a single functional model will not accurately match the growth curve. Perhaps the best example if this is in interventions, in which the growth curve during the intervention phase is likely to be completely different from the growth curve during the follow-up phase. That’s what we have “piecewise” GCMs for! See Chapter 6 in S&amp;W for more information on piecewise models and non-linear models. 5.4.1 How to Code Piecewise Models - Jump or No Jump? There are many ways to code a piecewise model (PM).You first have to decide whether to allow a “jump” or change in the level of the GCM between phases. If you do not want a “between-phase” jump, you include 2 time variables. If you want to allow a jump, you include 2 time variables and a dummy variable that codes “phase” (e.g., phase10=0 for asmts during phase 1, and phase10=1 for asmts during phase 2). No Jump These are used most typically when you have frequent assessments, usually without an important event between different phases (the important event can start at the discontinuity, just not between two assessments). Example: the follow-up period starts immediately after the last “treatment” in an intervention. The 2 time variables usually include a variable coded to reflect TIME during each phase of the study, centered at an important point (usually at the point of discontinuity). Thus, if you have weekly asmts, and asmt 5 is posttreatment, I would center it at asmt 5 (Timec5). Then, Time during phase 1 is coded as your Timec5 variable through phase 1, and then 0’s thereafter (I would call this variable Timec5p1). Thus, time during the first phase is the change in your time variable between asmts (centered at the end of phase 1), and then 0s (no change) afterward. d. The second time variable would code time as 0 during the first phase of the study (asmts 1-5) and then set to equal Timec5 during the second phase of the study (e.g., Timec5p2=0 for asmts 0-5, and is 1,2,3,4,5 for asmts 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). (see the coding table below) Jump These models are typically used when there are longer time differences between asmts and/or when the discontinuity should have a large effect on the LEVEL of the DV as well as the change in the DV over time (e.g., a traumatic event or a developmental milestone). The models for a jump are similar to the models above, with the addition of a “phase” dummy variable (typically coded phase10=0 for phase 1, and phase10=1 for phase 2). \\(Y = b0 +b1*Timec5p1 + b2*Timec5p2 + b3*Phase10\\) The phase dummy variable should be coded 0 at the assessment at which the time variables are centered (where they are 0). 5.5 Further notes on nonlinear growth curves SEM models can be used to calculate exact coding of time that will best fit the data, which is often advantageous. On the other hand, the advantage of using one of these other functional transformations of time is that, even though they don’t fit the model as well, they at least imply a straightforward functional relationship between outcome and time. One should graph the growth curves to understand the shape of the curves and to see the effects of the interactions. Because of the way Excel works in creating a graph, it is important that your x-axis variable (usually Time) reflects the range of the Time variable proportionately. Why do we look at all of these weird potential growth curves? We don’t know how to mathematically model the processes that contribute to the change in psychological variables over time. We generally hypothesize that change will be impacted by certain factors (i.e., recall of facts given during the intervention, use of techniques given during the intervention), but we do not know exactly how (mathematically) the components of the intervention are related to outcome. Plus, we don’t know how all the many components of a given intervention might work together to produce the outcome. 5.6 Homework 4 - 09/12 The attached data set are results comparing 2 treatments for PTSD (coded in the variable innovatively named condition; person centered therapy=0, prolonged exposure=1). The outcome is CPSSIE, which measures PTSD severity. Use week as your time variable. Do a quadratic, LN, and a hyperbolic time model. Center time at the last assessment (week=66), which is the 1 year follow-up. Which model fits the data best? Are there treatment condition differences at the last assessment in the best fitting model? For simplicity, only use a random effect for the intercept. Do not use a random effect for the slope(s).

In the best performing model, condition has a significance of &lt;.001, meaning there are significant differences in treatment conditions at the last assessment. 5.7 Homework 5 - 09/14 Using the data from the homework that we went over today, do a piecewise growth curve model, with the discontinuity at week 26. I copy the previous description of the data set below. Center time at week 66. Include the treatment x time interaction for time during phase 1 and for time during phase 2. Include as many random effects as will converge. Then repeat the analysis using a hyperbolic growth curve with as many random effects as will converge. Which fits the data better, piecewise or hyperbolic? Be ready to interpret the results of both models. Hyperbolic Model Interpretations of Fixed Effects condition: The difference between the two conditions in terms of CPSSIE at week 66 is significant. weekhyperc.99: The effect of time on CPSSIE is significant for participants in condition 0 (PCT). The slope of improvement in CPSSIE for people in condition 0 (-14 which means they’re improving a lot). condition*weekhyperc.99 interaction: Also the change in CPSSIE over time is different between the two conditions, since this term is significant. The rate of decrease in symptoms is more negative in condition 1 than in 0 over time. Interpretations of Covariance Parameters Intercept (UN1,1): There is significant variability in the intercepts of the individual CPSSIE scores around the estimated average of their conditions at the last time point. Covariance (UN2,1): The higher the slope, the higher the intercept for each individual on average as this is a positive value for. Slope (UN2,2): An individual’s average slope does significantly vary around the average slope. Piecewise Model Interpretations of Fixed Effects condition: The effect of condition on CPSSIE is significant. In other words, the difference between the two conditions in terms of CPSSIE is significant at week 66 and only at week 66. Weekc66ph1: The effect of time on CPSSIE is significant for participants in condition 0 (PCT) during the first phase. The slope of improvement in CPSSIE for people in condition 0 (negative which means they’re improving a lot). The slope of decrease in symptoms are significant during phase 1. Weekc66ph2: The effect of time on CPSSIE is not significant for participants in condition 0 (PCT) during the second phase. The slope of improvement in CPSSIE for people in condition 0 (0 which means they’re not improving a lot). The change in symptoms over time is not significant over time, collapsed over the two conditions. Weekc66ph1*condition interaction: The change in CPSSIE over time is different between the two conditions, since this term is significant. There is a significant change in CPSSIE over time between the two conditions for the first phase of the study. The rate of decrease in symptoms is more negative in condition 1 than in 0 for phase 1 Weekc66ph2*condition interaction: There is not a significant change in CPSSIE over time between the two conditions for the second phase of the study. Interpretations of Covariance Parameters Intercept (UN1,1): There is significant variability of the individual CPSSIE scores around the estimated average of their conditions at the last time point for phase 1. Covariance (UN2,1): The higher the slope, the higher the intercept for each individual on average as this is a positive value for phase 1. Slope (UN2,2): An individual’s average slope does significantly vary around the average slope for phase 1. Intercept (UN3,1): There is significant variability of the individual CPSSIE scores around the estimated average of their conditions at the last time point for phase 2. Covariance (UN3,2): However, there is not a significant relationship between the slope and intercept for each individual for CPSSIE scores for phase 2. Slope (UN3,3): An individual’s average slope does significantly vary around the average slope for phase 1. Piecewise fits best because AIC is lower!
